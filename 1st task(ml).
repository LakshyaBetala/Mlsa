Q1: Variance, Standard Deviation, and Interquartile Range (IQR) of Salaries in HR and Marketing Departments

for this question i used the pandas library to read the dataset using read_csv function and found the departments present in the dataset
department: hr, sales, research and development 

after seprating the data into hr_dept and marketing dept

I calculate variance using var()
standard deviation using std()
interquartile using quantiile()

Q2: What is the range of experience in the IT department?

since there is not department named IT, I assumed the IT department based on Education field == Technical degree.
Range = max() - min() 

Q3: Create a boxplot to display the experience of each department.

now we use the matplotlib (library)

in x axis is the department 
in y axis is the total working years

Q4:Which feature has the highest standard deviation in the dataset?

since the first column is emp id which consist of numericals such as RM so we exclude the first column and filter the column only having numerical values
then we find standard eviation for all the numeric columns and find the highest standarad deviation feature and its value
